Add the **"Ask AI Assistant" tab** on the **Lesson Details Page** by implementing a **two-column AI chat interface** with a **navigation sidebar** for managing multiple chat topics.
The page currently has:
- A **video player at the top**
- A **tabbed interface in the lower half**

Your task: Add a "Ask AI Assistant" tab
1. Refactor the existing chat UI to be a **two-column layout**:
   - **Left Column (Sidebar):**
     - Displays a list of **saved chat topics/titles** (e.g., “Understanding useEffect”, “React Lifecycle Explained”)
     - Each item is clickable and loads the corresponding chat history in the right panel
     - Highlight the active chat topic
     - Add a floating **“+ New Chat” button** at the top of the sidebar to start a fresh conversation
   - **Right Column (Chat Panel):**
     - Displays the full chat history for the selected topic
     - Includes message bubbles from both the user and AI bot, styled differently
     - At the bottom, show an input field and send button for new messages
     - Show a typing/loading indicator when the AI is "thinking"
2. Simulate the AI assistant behavior:
   - When a new chat is started, prompt the AI with a greeting like _"What would you like to know about this lesson?"_
   - Allow users to type questions related to the current lesson
   - Display a simulated response after a short delay (use keyword-based mock logic or hardcoded answers)
   - Save each new chat as a titled entry in the sidebar (e.g., based on the first question or auto-title like “Chat #1”)
3. UI/UX Requirements:
   - Use avatars/icons for both user and AI bot
   - Differentiate message styles (colors, alignment) for user vs AI
   - Responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile
   - Match the app’s visual style using Tailwind CSS or Material UI
   - Smooth transitions between chats and loading states
4. Data Handling:
   - Store chat topics and histories in React state
   - No backend or persistence needed — session-based only
   - Mock data can be used to pre-fill some chat topics/history
5. Component Structure:
   - Keep the components modular and reusable:
     - `ChatSidebar`
     - `ChatPanel`
     - `ChatMessage`
     - `ChatInput`
     - `NewChatButton`

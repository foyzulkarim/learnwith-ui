# Google Authentication Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Frontend

1. **API Client (`src/lib/api.ts`)**
   - Created a standardized API client for communicating with the backend
   - Implemented cookie-based JWT authentication support
   - Added methods for auth-related API endpoints

2. **Auth Context (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
   - Updated to use real API instead of mock data
   - Implemented Google OAuth redirection for login/register
   - Added auth state persistence using HTTP-only cookies
   - Implemented error handling for auth failures

3. **Protected Route Component (`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)**
   - Created component to protect routes that require authentication
   - Handles redirect to login page for unauthenticated users
   - Shows loading state while checking authentication

4. **App Component (`src/App.tsx`)**
   - Updated routes to use ProtectedRoute for secure sections
   - Added proper protection for course, profile, and dashboard routes

5. **Login/Register Pages**
   - Updated to use real OAuth flow instead of mock data
   - Removed GitHub authentication references (only Google is implemented in backend)
   - Fixed UI flows for a seamless authentication experience

### Environment Setup

1. **Type Definitions**
   - Added TypeScript definitions for Vite environment variables
   - Fixed type errors for proper TypeScript support

2. **Documentation**
   - Created AUTH-SETUP.md with setup instructions
   - Added implementation summary for maintenance

## How It Works

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User clicks login/register button
   - Frontend redirects to backend's `/api/auth/google` endpoint
   - Backend redirects to Google OAuth page
   - User authenticates with Google
   - Google redirects back to backend's callback URL
   - Backend processes the authentication, creates/updates user, and sets JWT cookie
   - Backend redirects to frontend with authentication complete
   - Frontend reads the JWT cookie on protected routes

2. **Protected Routes**
   - Routes requiring authentication are wrapped with ProtectedRoute component
   - Component checks for valid authentication
   - Redirects to login if unauthenticated

3. **Logout Flow**
   - User clicks logout in the UI
   - Frontend calls logout API endpoint
   - Backend clears the auth cookie
   - User is redirected to home page

## Implementation Notes

- Using HTTP-only cookies for JWT improves security
- Authentication state is checked on application startup
- Error handling is in place for authentication failures
- The implementation follows the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
